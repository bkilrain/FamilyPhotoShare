      <p>Welcome to my crappy little website. When choosing </p>
      <p>photos to upload or download, the quality has not</p>
      <p>been lowered at all. This means it might take a long</p>
      <p>time to do stuff. Patience is a virtue... Mother.</p>
      <h4>Things:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want to select multiple photos you can:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>On Mobile: long press the first photo you select... then select normally</li>
            <li>On laptop: hold shift or control or command as you click all your photos</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If you get an alert that there was a problem uploading, check the batch to see what files didn't upload... you can try again and enter the same name to append the photos that didn't make it.</li>
        <li>If you want to share a batch, share the the url from the address bar.</li>
        <li>If you have a problem or a suggestion or praise... send me an email: firstInitial.lastName at gmail. I'd like to polish this up so it's easy to use and it works well. Tell me what sucks so I can get better at not making sucky things.
